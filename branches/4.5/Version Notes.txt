Version 4.4
- Feature: Simulink Template allows automatic model generation and update
- Modified: Various tweaks to Elements to improve reliability and accuracy
- Modified: Ramper for changing from CR command to Actuator command fixed

Version 4.3
- Feature: Improved RT model timing

Version 4.2.4 
- Modified: Modified switch statement to allow materialType 6 in the section material type in the CopySectionsToMatrix.m 
- Feature: a new section model is implemented. this new section needs to verify with other software program (not done)


Version 4.2.3
- Feature: Added DOFNumberer.m which number the degree of freedoms including restrained and constrained dofs.
- Feature: Added MaterialState.m for material state determination 
- Feature: Use message dlg box for input error flag, instead of texting on the command window screen   
- Feature: RDV 3D Model Generator script available to convert input file into 3D model
- Modified: Input file format has been changed. It no longer requires dof numbers on the node data block.
- Modified: LoadConfiguration.m is modified. Dof number is generated by computer code. New data blocks have been created below the node data block to describe boundary conditions and constrained information
- Modified: CreateStructure.m has been modified and Model data structure includes new member data arrayes for boundary conditions, and constrained information.
- Modified: CreateNodes.m has been modified and the member variables for dof numbers of the node are deleted. 
- Modified: CreateMaterial.m has been modified to include SDegrading material model
- Modified: GetRestoringForce_Type8,9.m and SectionState.m have been modified. 
            Subfunction for material state determination has been moved to MaterialState.m
            Insteading calling element specific material subfunction, call MaterialState function.
- Modified: CreateElement_Type4.m is modified as a dummy column element. The mass is assigned on the nodes and PD effect can be included
            This element does not requires geometric stiffness on the input file. Instead, dummy column element shares the same nodes with elastic beam column element (ElementType1).
            The stiffness is calculated using the weight assigned to the element.
- Modified: CreateStaticLoading.m has been modified to be compatible with input format.
- Modified: Modified if statement to allow materialType 6 in the SectionState.m. 
- Modified: Nodes is now accessible in the workspace

Version 4.2.2
- Feature: Added ModelGenerator.m which generates a Simulink model from an input file.
- Feature: A new feature is added to account for the effect of Gravity Load. CreateStaticLoading.m and StaticAnalysis.m are newly added, LocalSimulatorSetup.m, GetEQHistory.m, LoadConfiguration.m, GenerateCommands.m and UpdateAccelerationCR.m are modified. The input file now has a parameter for NGN or Number of Gravity Nodes.
- Modified: Cleaned up names in the HybridFEM library which requires relinked with previous models.
- Modified: Starting step is now 2, not 1.  Step 1 is used for initialization.


Version 4.2.1
- Feature: Element 9 and Material 5 added to both LocalSimulation and Realtime Model.
- Modified: LoadConfiguration.m, CalculateMatrices.m and LocalSimulator.m to accommodate Element 9.
- Modified: CalculateMaterials.m to accommodate a trilinear material model.
- Modified: Use -1 instead of high number outside of NumFreeDOF for defining Node DOFs.
- Modified: LocalSimulator and Realtime_Model setup script redefined.


Version 4.2
- Feature: Required Integration method is defined in input file under INTEGRATOR.
- Feature: Rosenbrock-W explicit integration method available.
- Feature: Integration parameters available depending upon type defined.
- Feature: Interpolations added to input file which defines the base rate of the controller.
- Feature: Additional Material Types and properties to input file.
- Feature: Section properties added to input file.
- Feature: Elements 6, 7 and 8 added to LocalSimulation.
- Feature: Elements 6, 7 and 8 added to Realtime Model with BilinearMaterial properties.
- Feature: MNS MR Damper model added to library for Local Experimental Restoring Force generation.
- Modified: GetEQHistory.m allows for Rosenbrock-W 2 stage integration step by interpolating EQ history.
- Modified: LoadConfiguration.m and CreateIntegrator.m allows for Integration method to be selected from input file.
- Modified: CalculateMatricies.m and InitializeIntegrator.m for Rosenbrock-W modifications.
- Modified: InitializeIntegrator.m has Lambda modification for CR parameters, Alpha1 and Alpha 2.
- Modified: Fixed a bug in GetRestoringForce_Type3.m; no bug in Simulink version.
- Added: CopySectionsToMatrix.m to allow for Element Sections in Simulink.
